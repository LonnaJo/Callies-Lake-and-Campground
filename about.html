     <h3> About</h3>
   <p>Hi there! I am Shane Bowen and I recently opened Callie's Lake and Campground to camping and fishing for campers in and around the Kentucky area. Our site is located at 260 Bowen Road on Bowen Farms in Bowen, Kentucky, in the heart of Red River Gorge. We strive to offer you a safe, clean, and beautiful place to camp and fish. We have 35 primitive sites and a catch-and-release pay lake for campers at this time. 

<br>The property was named after owner Shane Bowen's great-grandmother, Callie, who passed away in 1969. She was the original owner and the Bowen family decided it was the perfect name for their business. The lake and campground are located on a 50-acre piece of property behind the Bowen First Church of God.

In addition to a four-acre pay lake that is stocked full of fish, there are many hiking trails on the property for the nature lovers. For history buffs, there is a cemetery on the property that dates back to slavery days.

<br>We invite you to consider our site for your next event, especially weddings, concerts, and motorcycle meets. We offer a beautiful place next to the lake called the point and it is decorated with flower gardens, benches, and tables to create the perfect, scenic wedding.
